# GitLabCI at ARC-TS
### Presented by Jeffrey Sica

Jeffrey Sica is a Senior Research Database Administrator for Advanced Research Computing - Technology Services at the University of Michigan. In this talk, Jeff will give an overview of Gitlab's use at UM's HPC group (https://arc-ts.umich.edu) including some some common practices and how GitLab's CI/CD features are put to use in research computing. Afterwards, Jeff goes config-file diving to show some of the different ways you can build a GitOps-esque workflow for your application.
