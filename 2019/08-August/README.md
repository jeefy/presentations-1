# Building Kubernetes Operators with Ansible Talk

### Presented by Chris Short

Operators simplify the management of complex applications, but are usually written in Go and require expertise with the internals of Kubernetes. Using the Operator SDK, Ansible becomes a first-class citizen! It has lowered the barrier to entry and has made it easy to orchestrate your applications across both new & existing platforms with one simple language. Come learn all about this new phase of infrastructure automation!

The entrance to the venue is at the BACK of the building, there is a green door that is propped open.

Food by CNCF, Location by Duo. Amazing experience? All you!
