# Exploring IPv6 at Home: Preparing for the Future of the Internet Protocol
### Presented by Matt Layher

Matt Layher is a Distributed Systems Engineer at Fastly, and a regular
contributor to a wide variety of open source networking applications and
libraries written in Go.

In this talk, Matt will discuss some of the fundamental ideas of IPv6,
enumerating many of the differences between IPv6 and IPv4. He will use real
world examples to aid in the discussion, concluding with a demonstration of how
to set up IPv6 at home using DHCPv6 prefix delegation with Ubiquiti EdgeMAX
equipment.
