# Linkerd and 3rd Party APIs
### Presented by Brandon Dimcheff

Brandon Dimcheff, a long-time Ann Arborite and engineer at Openly, will discuss Linkerd: the kubernetes-native service mesh letting you easily monitor, debug, and increase service reliability. Brandon will delve into how Openly has leveraged Linkerd to gain visibility into external services as if they were running locally. He’ll present a live demo showcasing Linkerd’s capabilities while covering gotchas and surprises found through the adoption journey.

Thanks to Ithaka for hosting!
